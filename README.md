# Project Scope


Background
Citi-Bikes
Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Analysis of Tableau Worksheet:

I decided to use the CSV's covering June 2020 - November 2020 to compare seasonal data with a large enough dataset. I used Jupyter notebook to combine the CSV's (Notebook attached for reference)

Once this was combined I then went to analyse the data in Tableau, creating calculated fields for the areas I wanted to analyse (Season, Age, Weekend/Weekday)

Top Data Findings from the Tableau Notebook:

1. The starting stations and area locations.
